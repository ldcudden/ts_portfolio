<h1>My Story</h1>
<p>
I am a freelance video editor. I have worked on corporate, non-profit, commercial and wedding videos. I started out as a prepress technician and worked for various print houses and InfoWorld Magazine. While working for InfoWorld, I developed an interest in web design. After a few months of self-study, I was asked to train the prepress department in creating web pages as InfoWorld made the transition from paper to the web.
</p>

<p>
My web experience later brought me to Sun Microsystems, where I was a web designer for java.sun.com. The pinnacle of that experience was when, after working only a few months, I was asked to design the website for the annual JavaOne conference in San Francisco and later for the conference in Japan. I continued to design the sites for three years until most design responsibilities were contracted to an outside company. As it is with all things, that job came to an end. But I was already looking into going back to school. I have a B/A in art from San Jose State University, but I wanted to give the film industry a try. The film and video industry was growing more and more accessible as post production moved from large media stations to the Mac desktop. I decided to study film and video production at De Anza College, and after less than two years, I had my A/A in Film and Video Production with a 3.9 GPA.
</p>

<p>
It was tough finding a job in the industry. I did a few internships and finally got a position as an associate editor with Transvideo Studios. Transvideo was a preferred vendor for Google and I cut my editorial teeth on projects for Google, including testimonials, event highlights, product launches and tutorials. Since we were basically starting a new department, I also helped in the development of new workflows, training new hires, creating encoding workflows, and writing training documentation.
</p>

<p>
Since leaving Transvideo I have freelanced for CreaTV San Jose, Camp Creative, The Lancaster Group, Siebel Scholars, and I even got a chance to go back to Sun and freelance as a video editor. My work for CreaTV and The Lancaster Group has won recognition from the Alliance for Community Media 2010 WAVE Awards. My first project as producer, director, editor and videographer was a finalist in the CreaTV 2011 “CreaTiVe” awards in the Creative Excellence in Editing category.

<p>
I work hard to craft a clean and coherent narrative and look forward to creating videos that engage, entertain, educate and inspire.
